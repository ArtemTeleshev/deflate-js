  <h1><span>deflate-js</span>: DEFLATE in JavaScript</h1>
  <p>
    <span>deflate-js</span> is a pure JavaScript implementation of the DEFLATE algorithm. DEFLATE is a popular compression algorithm used both as a stand-alone compression and in the popular GZIP file format.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  With HTML5, complex web application are being written, and there is still no good way to compress data in the browser. The W3 specification gives no way to call native code from a client-side application and most browser APIs are hidden as well. One solution is to make a browser extension to do the heavy lifting, but this obviously requires users to install the extension just to use functionality. This is, of course, not preferred, and this project tries to solve that problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Live Example</h2>
  <div class='table'>
    <div class='row'>
      <div class='cell'>
        <label>Plain Text</label>
        <br />
        <textarea id="inflated" cols="64" rows="16"></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class='cell'>
        <->
      </div>
      <div class='cell'>
        <label>Output (base64 encoded)</label>
        <br />
        <textarea id="deflated" cols="64" rows="16"></textarea>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Use Cases</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text editors (compress to reduce bandwidth)</li>
      <li>Generating compressed tarballs</li>
      <li>Pushing server-side tasks involving compressed data to the client</li>
      <li>Show off</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    <span>deflate-js</span> is built to work with <a href='https://github.com/coolaj86/node-pakmanager'>pakmanager</a>, a package builder for the browser. This means that it follows node-style requires:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      var DEFLATE = require('deflate-js');

      // compress a string
      var compressed = DEFLATE.deflate('Hello World');

      // decompress a compressed string
      var decompressed = DEFLATE.inflate(compressed);
    </code>
  <pre>
</body>
